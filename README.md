//We are to have three catigorys of retaurnts, we want to program to display one of the restruaunts form each of the three catigorys. We also add data validation and a play again feture.
//Peer Review: Lerissa Lazar- You have 10 restaraunts in 3 categories which is right, but there's no data validation. When I enter "sadfg" as "playAgain" it just continues and gives me 3 new restaraunts, also when I enter "no" as "end" it continues again and gives me another 3 restraunts.
